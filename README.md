# ORMJS: Object Role Modeling in JavaScript

> :warning: This project is in active development. Consider everything an alpha prototype. Release notes will be published here.

ORMJS is a completely clientside implementation of ORM, accessible from any modern browser. It is implemented in javascript d3v7.

With ORMJS you can:
- Generate ORM via an intuitive GUI interface.
- Save your ORM diagram as an SVG.
- Upload ORM SVG files generated by ORMJS and continue editing them.
- Generate Rel code from your ORMJS model.

See the latest version of ORMJS deployed [here](https://crhunt.github.io/ormjs/).

## What is Object Role Modeling (ORM)

From the [ORM website](http://www.orm.net/):

> Object Role Modeling (ORM) is a powerful method for designing and querying database models at the conceptual level, where the application is described in terms easily understood by non-technical users. In practice, ORM data models often capture more business rules, and are easier to validate and evolve than data models in other approaches.

## Rel plus ORM

[Rel](https://docs.relational.ai/getting-started/rel/overview/) is an expressive, declarative, and relational language designed for modeling domain knowledge. The language is designed to work with the RelationalAI Knowledge Graph Management System. 

ORMJS generates Rel code on-the-fly from the ORM model.

## How to interact with ORMJS

ORMJS is actively being developed and most user functions are still missing. If you'd like to toy with ORMJS in it's current state, try the following click commands:

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
|Dblclick | Generate new entity |
|Shift + Dblclick | Generate new rolebox |
|Ctrl + Click | Delete object |
